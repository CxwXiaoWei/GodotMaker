"""Regression tests for gdUnit4 addon path casing.

After 2026-05-10 we standardised on capital-U `addons/gdUnit4/` to
match the upstream MikeSchulze/gdUnit4 repo layout. Earlier the
`config/addon_versions.json` install_path was lowercase
`addons/gdunit4/`, which created a class-registry double-registration
trap on Windows: the verify command used capital-U while the
on-disk directory was lowercase, so Godot's class registry registered
each gdUnit4 class twice (once per literal path string) and emitted
`Class "..." hides a global script class` parse errors.

At the same time we deleted references to `gdunit4_run.gd` -- a
fabricated v6+ runner that never existed in any pinned tag (v5.1.1,
v6.1.0). The actual runner is `bin/GdUnitCmdTool.gd` for every
supported gdUnit4 release.

These tests scan production assets (skills, agents, tools, config,
migrations) for any reintroduction of those bad shapes. Frozen
historical artefacts under `docs/` (CHANGELOG, release notes, wiki)
are intentionally NOT scanned -- they describe past behaviour
truthfully.
