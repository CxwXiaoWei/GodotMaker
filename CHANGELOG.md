# Changelog

All notable changes to GodotMaker will be documented in this file.

Format: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) — MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added

- Shared reference docs mechanism (`skills/core/_shared/`) deployed via `publish_shared_refs()` into each consumer skill's `references/` (auto-generated, single source of truth).
- Per-scene visual targets — `/gm-asset` generates `references/scene_*.png`; `/gm-evaluate` compares running screenshots against them via the `visual-qa` skill (Static / Dynamic templates, frame sequences under `e2e/screenshots/scene_{name}/frame_*.png`).

### Changed

- Pipeline split into 9 role-based skills (`gm-scaffold` → `gm-gdd` → `gm-asset` → `gm-build` → `gm-verify` → `gm-evaluate` → `gm-fixgap` → `gm-accept` → `gm-finalize`). `.godotmaker/current_role` file lock enforces per-role write scope at hook level. Stage transitions recorded in `.godotmaker/stage.jsonl` (was `stage.json`).
- Hooks rewritten for the role model — `check_stage_prerequisites.py` uses `PREREQ_ROLE`; `stage_reminder.py` validates per-role outputs from `config/stage_schemas.json`; `on_subagent_stop.py` serialises `log_subagent` + `check_worker_report` to avoid race on `metrics_current.jsonl`.
- Wiki rewritten end-user-facing — 28 pages across 8 sections (getting-started, concepts, skills, troubleshooting, tools, configuration, contributing, reference). `mkdocs.yml` nav and landing page synced.

### Fixed

- Cleared 24 ruff lint errors across `hooks/`, `tools/`, `tests/` and a real `NameError` in `tools/rembg_matting.py` (`bg_color` referenced before assignment in `--preview` branch).
- Aligned `pyproject.toml` version with `VERSION` file.

### Removed

- `harness/` code and docs migrated out into the separate `external automation host` repository.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-26

Initial public release.

- 8-stage orchestrator pipeline with hook-enforced gates (requirements → architecture → scaffold → assets → risk impl → main impl → integration → final)
- Worker / verifier / reviewer / analyst subagent dispatch with format-validated reports
- 13 core skills (orchestrator, godot-api, headless-build, gdunit-driver, gdtoolkit, gecs, game-planner, project-scaffold, visual-qa, screenshot, mcp-driver, godot-e2e, input-mapper) and 8 reviewer skills (physics, animation, ui, tilemap, navigation, shader, audio, particles)
- 8 hooks: file permission enforcement, stage prerequisite gating, completion checks, subagent report validation, session bookkeeping, anti-deadloop protection, worktree-aware file resolution
- `tools/publish.py` deploys the framework into a target Godot project, with version tracking and upgrade prompts
- Static checks: `check_project.py` for project completeness, `check_classname.py` for Godot built-in collisions
- Asset pipeline helpers (`asset_gen.py`, `rembg_matting.py`, `tripo3d.py`)
- Wiki documentation (30 pages across 8 sections)
- 193+ unit tests for hooks and tools
